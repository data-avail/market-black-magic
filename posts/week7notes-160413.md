- average men (last n days)
- upper band - sell
- lower - buy

    calc stdev over 10 days
    upper - avg latest 10 + stdev
    lower - avg - stdev
    convert these price to one


For volatile bigger band needed

    mid = 'rolling' over lookback period
    std = stdev over lookback]]upper = mid + std
    lower = mid - std
    val = (price - mid / std)
